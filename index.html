        <h2>Piece of Artistic Expression</h2>
        <p>
            The story “Nothing but the Truth” by Avi is about a student named Philip Malloy who was supposedly 
            suspended for humming "The Star Spangled Banner" when his teacher, Ms. Margaret Narwin, repeatedly 
            told him to be quiet. When Philip went to plead his case to others, he argued that it was a free 
            country and he was just being patriotic, so others were shocked and horrified that Philip got 
            suspended. However, what they don't understand is that Philip got suspended for repeatedly disobeying 
            Ms. Narwin, not for being patriotic. Either way, the media got involved and the story that was run 
            was Philip's version, not the teacher's version. There was an outpour of negative reactions toward 
            the school officials and a lot of support for Philip. The story show's how one lie can impact the 
            lives of many others. Ms. Narwin felt the need to resign from her teaching position, Harrison lost 
            the funding it desperately needed, and Philip had to transfer to another school. His lie unravels 
            at the end of the book when at Washington Academy, his new school, he is asked to sing the national 
            anthem. Philip begins to cry and finally reveals the truth, "I don't know the words."

            For my artistic piece I created a Graphic Interchange Format or GIF in photoshop to represent the 
            theme of the story. The GIF shows Philip Malloy running away from Harrison and toward the American 
            flag. However, there is also a fire behind Philip. The fire represents Philip's own 
            destruction/childish ways and alludes to the popular childhood phrase, "Liar, liar, pants on fire." 
            Even though Philip is running (track is important to him) toward the American flag (representing 
            his apparent singing "The Star Spangled Banner"), he will never get there because he never sang it 
            (the fire), he doesn't even know the words. He lied, and he's running away from the truth that lies 
            with the school officials at Harrison (the school building).
